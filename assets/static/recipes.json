    "instructions": [
        "Preheat the oven to 400F and line a baking sheet with parchment. If you don't already have quinoa prepared, cook it according to package directions at this time. 1/3 a cup of dry quinoa will typically lend 1 cup cooked.", 
        "Place the chickpeas, onion, cauliflower and sweet potato on the sheet pan, and drizzle with oil, and then the spices. You can do this in a bowl for easier preparation, if desired. Roast for 35 minutes, until the sweet potato and cauliflower are slightly soft.",
        "While the vegetables roast, prepare your high protein dressing. In a blender, combine the tofu, parsley, dill, nutritional yeast, salt, lemon, garlic and water. Combine until smooth, adding more water as needed to reach a desired consistency.",
        "When the vegetables are roasted, place a bed of spinach in a bowl, and disperse the toppings as desired, with fresh avocado and cucumber on top. If desired, add pickled onions and dill. Drizzle on the high protein dressing and enjoy."
