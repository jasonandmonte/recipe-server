        "While the vegetables roast, prepare your high protein dressing. In a blender, combine the tofu, parsley, dill, nutritional yeast, salt, lemon, garlic and water. Combine until smooth, adding more water as needed to reach a desired consistency.",
        "When the vegetables are roasted, place a bed of spinach in a bowl, and disperse the toppings as desired, with fresh avocado and cucumber on top. If desired, add pickled onions and dill. Drizzle on the high protein dressing and enjoy."
